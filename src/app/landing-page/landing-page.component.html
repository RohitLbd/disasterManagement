                <h3>Earthquake</h3>
                <p>Seismic activity involves sudden ground shaking caused by movements in the Earth's crust. It can lead to destruction of infrastructure, loss of life, landslides, and tsunamis. Aftershocks often follow the main event, causing additional damage. Buildings collapse, roads crack, and services such as water, electricity, and communication can be disrupted. Earthquakes can also cause secondary disasters like fires and floods.</p>

                <h3>Flood</h3>
                <p>Floods occur when water overflows onto dry land. They can result from heavy rains, river overflows, or dam breaks. Floods destroy homes, businesses, and crops, and can cause contamination of water supplies. People may face displacement, food shortages, and disease outbreaks due to stagnant water. Floods also lead to erosion and long-term damage to ecosystems and infrastructure.</p>

                <h3>Hurricane</h3>
                <p>Hurricanes are intense tropical storms with strong winds and heavy rainfall. They cause widespread destruction by flooding coastal areas, damaging buildings, and uprooting trees. Storm surges and heavy rains lead to massive water damage, and high winds can destroy power lines and communication networks. Hurricanes can also trigger landslides and tornadoes, compounding their destructive impact.</p>
